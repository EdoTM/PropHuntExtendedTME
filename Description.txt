Based on the original "Prop Hunt" game mode, Xaymar's Custom Prop Hunt brings you some much needed changes to freshen up the gamemode. 

New features: 
- Easy configuration - configuration is now stored inside data\prop_hunt\ as a key-values table! 
- Default Taunts are no longer infringing on copyrighted material - taunt your life away as a streamer or YouTuber! 
- Taunt Pack support - add new taunts by just downloading addons, no file modification needed! 
- Prop Rotation - Hit F4 and dance- err I ment rotate! 

Fixes: 
- Camera can now no longer glitch through the world. 
- Camera root position now closely follows the prop size. 
- Prop sizes are now set correctly - previously you could make your way behind things with props way too big. 
- Props can no longer heal themselves by becoming prop, they'll always keep the same percentage of health. 
- Picking a prop is now more accurate, picking from where your camera is looking.
