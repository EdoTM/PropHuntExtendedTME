Hide n Seek with a twist - Hiders can turn into anything on the map! From bottles, to vending machines and all the way to huge cars - what you become depends on how you want to play. Do you want to blend in with your surroundings, or do you want to make a fool of the Seekers? And how will you deal with finding (and killing) all hiders as a Seeker?

The Gamemode comes with out of the box support for console configuration (ph_*), custom taunt support, prop rotation, an improved code base for modders and better integration and some other fixes. Support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151583504]MapVote[/url] is also built in, so as long as you have a compatible addon installed you will get a map voting menu at the end of a match.

[h1]How To Play[/h1]
[b]Seekers[/b]
Your primary goal is to find hiders by any means possible. But watch out, you might lose health if you shoot an object that isn't actually a hider! Pick things up before shooting them, or simply remember the layout of the maps you are playing on. And remember: You lose if only a single hider is still alive at the end of the round.

[b]Hiders[/b]
Stay alive as long as possible and make Seekers look like a fool. Dance around their feet, hide in plain sight or be that huge car that nobody though you could become! What you do is entirely up to you.

[b]Spectators[/b]
You get to watch the whole thing go down live! Sit back, grab some popcorn or any other snack and relax.
