# Prop Hunt Extended
Hide n Seek with a twist - Hiders can turn into anything on the map! From bottles, to vending machines and all the way to huge cars - what you become depends on how you want to play. Do you want to blend in with your surroundings, or do you want to make a fool of the Seekers? And how will you deal with finding (and killing) all hiders as a Seeker?

## Features and Improvements
* **Prop Rotation**: Rotate your prop into the correct orientation to fool Seekers even more.
* **Correct Hitboxes**: All hitboxes now compensate for lag, making shots that should have hit actually hit.
* **Better Camera**: First- & Third-Person modes, world collision, proper world origin to support small hiding spaces without making the world disappear.
* **Custom Player Models**: Customize yourself to the best of your abilities.
* **Taunt Packs**: All taunt packs compatible with Tsukasas Taunt Pack Loader will work and load.
* **Name Plates and Selection Halo**: Know who is what, and what you're going to select!
* **Proper Scoreboard**: The gamemode comes with a proper Scoreboard instead of the default one.
* **Better Configuration**: Everything can be configured during gameplay using CVars.
* **Improved Networking Performance**: Only necessary information is shared.

## Compatibility with other Addons
* **[MapVote](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151583504)**: Full support
* **Tsukasas Taunt Pack Loader**: Compatibility layer included, not compatible due to this.
* **LiteGibs**: Breaks literally everything somehow.

# How To Play
## Seekers
Your primary goal is to find hiders by any means possible. But watch out, you might lose health if you shoot an object that isn't actually a hider! Pick things up before shooting them, or simply remember the layout of the maps you are playing on. And remember: You lose if only a single hider is still alive at the end of the round.

## Hiders
Stay alive as long as possible and make Seekers look like a fool. Dance around their feet, hide in plain sight or be that huge car that nobody though you could become! What you do is entirely up to you.

## Spectators
You get to watch the whole thing go down live! Sit back, grab some popcorn or any other snack and relax.
